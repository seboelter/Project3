#### Attempted Point Breakdown and Timestamps

##### Sarah's thoughts on what we should do:

I'm open to your thoughts, and my thoughts might change as I get into the code exampels, but at first glance at the pdf, imho the path of least effort/resistance is likely:
 
 Single-Multi Arm IK for 40 points
 Joint Limits 20 pts
 User Interaction 10
 IK obstacles 10

 Unless you really like 3D?  I don't really

Total is 90 pts

* Single-arm IK (at least 2D)* (up to 20 points).
* Multi-arm IK (at least 2D) (up to 20 points).[This will also count as single-arm IK meaning multi-arm IK totals up to 40 points.]
* Joint limits (up to 20 points)
* IK Obstacles (up to 20 points).
* User Interaction (up to 10 points).
* Moving IK (at least 2D) (up to 10 points).
* Re-rooting IK (at least 2D) (up to 20 points). [This will also count as
moving IK meaning re-rooting IK totals up to 30 points.]
* Motion Planning (up to 20 points).
* 3D Simulation (up to 10 points).
* 3D Rendering & Camera (up to 10 points).
* Skinned Models (up to 10 points).
* IK + Character Animation (up to 10 points).


### Part 2 Crowd Simmulation - 60 pts


##### Sarah's thoughts on what we should do:

I'm open to your thoughts, and my thoughts might change as I get into the code exampels, but imho the path of least effort/resistance is likely:

We could just do the crowd sim?

* Flocking (up to 10 points (grad), 10 points (undergrad)).
* Single Agent Navigation (up to 30 points (grad), 20 points (undergrad)).
* Anticipatory Collision Avoidance (up to 20 points (grad), 10 points (undergrad)).
* Full Crowd Simulation (up to 60 points (grad), 30 points (undergrad)).
[Note: you can either get points for the full crowd simulation or the components of
single-agent navigation and anticipatory collision avoidance, but not both]
